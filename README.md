## 👁️ What Is a Wallhack in Valorant?

Wallhack (ESP) lets you **visually detect enemies behind any surface**, like walls, boxes, smokes, and even Cypher cages. It doesn’t just show player models — it delivers **real-time data** like health, weapons, distance, and team info.

The cheat overlays 3D visuals onto your game so you always know where to pre-aim, push, or rotate. Perfect for ranked climbing or trolling in unrated matches. 😈
